                       Story line:<br>
                       The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York.
                       He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. 
                       Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, 
                       and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. 
                       But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it.
                       What follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all 
                       the other mafia families which could tear the Corleone family apart.
